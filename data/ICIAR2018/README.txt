i3S Annotated Datasets on Digital Pathology



WELCOME

In an effort to contribute and push forward the field of Digital Pathology, Ipatimup and INEB, two major research institutions in Portugal, have joined forces in the construction of histology datasets to support grand Challenges on automatic classification of tissue malignancy. The researchers/pathologists responsible for the datasets are:

António Polónia (MD), Ipatimup/i3S
apolonia@ipatimup.pt

Catarina Eloy (MD, PhD), Ipatimup/i3S
celoy@ipatimup.pt


Paulo Aguiar (PhD), INEB/i3S
pauloaguiar@ineb.up.pt



This specific page refers to the Grand Challenge on Breast Cancer Histology images, or BACH Challenge



THE BACH CHALLENGE DATASET

ICIAR 2018 - Grand Challenge on Breast Cancer Histology images [Challenge organized by Teresa Araújo, Guilherme Aresta, António Polónia, Catarina Eloy and Paulo Aguiar]
